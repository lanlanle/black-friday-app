<h3>BLACK FRIDAY APP</h3>
<p>In light of Thanksgiving ... and Black Friday, I create a texting app that let the user know the current deals of the stores for Black Friday. This app utilizes Twilio SMS API and GMail API(for the deal resource)</p>
<p>Below is the demo screenshots. If you still want to see how it really work, text +1 216 910 5265 to get the current deals from your favorite store !!!</p>
